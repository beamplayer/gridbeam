A single-axis solar tracking mounting system for a 39 inch x 65 inch (or 39 inch x 75 inch) PV panel.
The long side (39 inch) needs to be placed along the east-west direction.
This allows the panel to be tilted to the east in the morning (towards the sun) and gradually tilted to the west towards the night.
An eco-worthy stepper motor and solar tracking (electronics) system is used to tilt the panel. This is shown using a blue box.
This system would be +25% more efficient then a fixed PV mounting system.

When using imperial gridbeam, it can be made 24 inch (=2 foot) high, 42 inch (=3,5 foot) long and 78 inch (=6,5 foot) wide.
The panel can then be rotated by a stepper motor by putting it on a plywood supported by an axle. 
The axle needs to be at least 78 inch long (75" for the panel + 1,5" + 1,5" for the beams + space to mount the electric motor).
By making it this way, the whole has a limited height, which reduces the possibility of damage by wind.
Also it is made with the long side tiltable (rather then the short side being tiltable) because the axle is longer this way , is better secured and able to take more weight.
In the metric gridbeam version, it is 0,5m high, 1m long and 2m wide with a 2m wide axle.
The beams are secured in a box shape by means of angle plates. The inner frame is secured to the axle (this can not be seen in model).
Pollow block bearings are attached to the outer frame and allow the axle to rotate freely on them.
The inner frame is also rather small (beams are 1,5m and 0,8m).
