Add-on windscreen and fairings for a bicycle.
Some holes can be drilled into the bicycle frame after which the gridbeam bolt-on windscreen and fairings can be applied.
These will decrease the effect of wind/cold/rain and increase speed of the bicycle.
Since some wind/cold/rain will still remain, a raincoat and pull-over pants are still needed for cycling in all weather.
