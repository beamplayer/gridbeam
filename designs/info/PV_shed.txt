A simple gridbeam shed outfitted with PV panels on the roof to recharge the battery of an electric vehicle parked inside it. 
The shed is stand-alone so does not require a power line to be layed towards it. Also, since the power comes from a PV panel, 
you are certain that your vehicle is recharged using only renewable power (when recharging from the grid, you can't be certain of
this. The amount of PV panels placed on the roof depend on what vehicle battery needs to be recharged with it, the time frame
against which it needs to be recharged and the location of the shed (countries near the equator get more hours of sunlight, at even 
greater intensity upto a maximum of about 2000W/h/m²). You can check the numbers at

For instance, let's assume we need to charge an electric trike within 24 hours. The electric trike is powered with a Bafang 36V,
250W rear motor and a 36V 13-17A battery (=468-612 Watt). With a 250W engine, that means 468-612/250= 1,87 to 2,44 hours of riding
at speeds well above 30 km/h. Range would be between 45-75 km at least (assumption).

The PV shed is located in the Netherlands (which receives at least 2h of sunlight per day @ 1000W/h/m², even in winter). Given the
cold weather in the Netherlands, we'll ride the trike with a breathable rain jacket (pullover-type) and waterproof pants and also
include a front fairing/windscreen on the trike.
We'll assume we're using a single 39" x 65" (=1,58m² panel) with 250W, 36V average output.
The panel is placed on the shed roof (preferably facing south, tilted at winter angle).
A 12/24/36/48V MPPT charge controller is placed in the shed, between PV panel and battery.
We can expect a cost of 375 euro of more for the 1,58 m² PV panel and a cost of 136 to 396 euro for the MPPT charge controller. 
At 15% efficiency, the PV panel outputs 237 watts per hour, at 20% efficiency, output is 316 watts. 
With 2 hours of sunshine @ 1000 watt/h/m² that makes 474 - 632 watts, so more than enough to recharge a 36V, 13-17A (=468-612 Watt)
battery (as we don't expect to lose more than 25% of energy during the charging, and as we also won't discharge it to below 20%).
