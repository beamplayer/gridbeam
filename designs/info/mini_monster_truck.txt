Design of a mini monster truck, based on the Mini Moke Shorty 
(see http://miniclub06.free.fr/?rep_rubrique=moke&page_centre=schmitt). 
This sports utility vehicle is intented to be used in areas with poor quality roads and should have the same capabilities as the Jeep CJ3A (Blitz Buggy).
It is not intented as a mode of transport in areas with good quality roads (use either a tricycle for that 
or an electric or biofuel-powered tuktuk, ie Terra Motors tuk-tuk in this case -which can attain speeds upto 70 kmph-).

Dimensions:
The vehicle would be similarin size to the CJ3A (see https://www.kaiserwillys.com/about_willys_jeep_cj3a_history_specs )
meaning: 10,25 feet L x 4,5 feet W x 3,08 feet H
The wheels of a standard CJ3A are 16 inch in diameter, but since we want the monster truck look, this is scaled up to 
about 1,6x (26 inch). 26 inch is also about the biggest size you can get in garden tractor wheels. Ground clearance of a standard CJ3A is just 9 inch (about 22 cm) so this either needs to be increased too (to 14 inch) or it needs to be completely outside of any wheel arch/chassis.
