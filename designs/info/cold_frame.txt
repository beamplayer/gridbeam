A cold-frame modeled after the "Swedish Homestead" cold frame.
It consists of 2 sides (plyboard, hardboard or ABS plastic, or simply made from 5 wooden boards of 16 cm or 7 inch in height).
The slope of the sides depends on your location. Use 45° slope at 20° latitude, 50° slope at 30° latitude, 60° slope at 40° latitude, 70° slope at 50° latitude, 80° slope at 60° latitude
Wooden gridbeams are used due to the better thermal properties (using alu or steel gridbeams would cool the cold frame).
The cold frame is best bolted straight unto a building (i.e. wooden shack) so that the back side does not need to be made.

Bill of Materials (imperial version):
4 wooden gridbeams of 3 foot in length
1 wooden gridbeam of 8 foot in length
2 sides (see above)

Bill of Materials (metric version):
4 wooden gridbeams of 0,8 meter in length
1 wooden gridbeam of 2,4 meter in length
2 sides (see above)
