Improved version of the 1.5 inch aluminium gridbeam set (https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/59a44de0b3f5694a4ae5e8dc149c74c/15-aluminum-gridbeam-set )
All imperial gridbeam versions (1 inch, 1.5 inch and 2 inch) are accurately modeled herein.
In the sketchup model, the 1 inch cubes are 25.4 mm cubes, 1.5 inch cubes are 38.1 mm cubes and 2 inch cubes are 50.8 mm cubes.
Only one segment is modelled, so duplicate this segment to make gridbeams.
To learn how to do this in sketchup: see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7jE2XpCnkg
This is only useful for openscad and openjscad models however, as in sketchup, it is easier to just model out beams (rather than duplicate segments).

For 1 inch gridbeam that means: hole size= 11/32 inch (8.73 mm), bolt size= 5/16 inch (7.93 mm)
For 1.5 inch gridbeam that means: hole size= 11/32 inch (8.73 mm), bolt size= 5/16 inch (7.93 mm)
For 2 inch gridbeam that means: hole size= 7/16 inch (11.11 mm), bolt size= 3/8 inch (9.52 mm)

Length of the gridbeams is per 1 foot and per 0.5 foot (upto a maximum length of 8 foot)

For coloring:
Wooden segments: brown (in sketchup, the brown is "0036 brown"
Alu/steel segments: grey
Segment surfaces where bolts go through the holes: blue (only useful for openscad and openjscad models)
Segment surfaces where axles go through the holes: yellow (only useful for openscad and openjscad models)
The segment surfaces where bolts go through are colored in blue so that no actual bolts need to be modeled out
Holes: "0137 black" (in sketchup, holes are drawn on cube, no surfaces are deleted)
